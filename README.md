# runner.nes

This is a brand new NES game that I'm writing on stream over on
[Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/zorchenhimer/)!  The vast majority of this
game has been written on stream with very little done off stream.

## Assembling the ROM

1. Follow this guide to setup the environment: [NES_Build_Environment.md ](https://gist.github.com/zorchenhimer/b5e1f30feb082f5a920c6b7e7a072b13)
2. `git clone https://github.com/zorchenhimer/nes-runner.git`
3. `cd nes-runner`
4. `make`

After `make` is run you should have a sub-directory named `bin/` that holds a
bunch of stuff, namely `runner.nes` and some symbols files for the both the
[Mesen](https://github.com/SourMesen/Mesen) and
[FCEUX](https://github.com/TASVideos/fceux) emulators.

## But why though?

Because it's fun!

## Where can I download the ROM?

Head on over to the relases page and grab it!
